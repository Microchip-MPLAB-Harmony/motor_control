  SYS CLK Static Functions for Clock System Service

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    plib_clk.c

  Summary:
    SYS CLK static function implementations for the Clock System Service.

  Description:
    The Clock System Service provides a simple interface to manage the
    oscillators on Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the static
    implementation for the Clock System Service.

  Remarks:
    Static functions incorporate all system clock configuration settings as
    determined by the user via the Microchip Harmony Configurator GUI.
    It provides static version of the routines, eliminating the need for an
    object ID or object handle.

    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

/* Function:
    void CLK_Initialize( void )

  Summary:
    Initializes hardware and internal data structure of the System Clock.

  Description:
    This function initializes the hardware and internal data structure of System
    Clock Service.

  Remarks:
    This is configuration values for the static version of the Clock System
    Service module is determined by the user via the MHC GUI.

    The objective is to eliminate the user's need to be knowledgeable in the
    function of the 'configuration bits' to configure the system oscillators.
