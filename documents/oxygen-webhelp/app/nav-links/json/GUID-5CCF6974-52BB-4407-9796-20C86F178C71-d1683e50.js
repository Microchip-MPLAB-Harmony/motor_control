Due to their permanent magnet rotor, they also have higher torque with         smaller frame size and no rotor current, all of which are advantages over AC Induction         Motors (AICMs). With their high power-to-size ratio, PMSMs can help make the design smaller         without the loss of torque. These strengths enable the usage of PMSM in a broad range of         variable frequency drives (VFDs) applications.<\/p>","href":"GUID-C1C929BC-0D12-40FB-B555-F28B23CB457E.html","attributes":{"data-id":"GUID-C1C929BC-0D12-40FB-B555-F28B23CB457E"},"menu":{"hasChildren":false},"tocID":"GUID-C1C929BC-0D12-40FB-B555-F28B23CB457E-d1683e61","topics":[]},{"title":"<ph>1.1.1.1.1.2<\/ph>\nCurrent Measurement","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">The phase current information is crucial to control the torque of the motor of an         electric drive with Field Oriented Control.
