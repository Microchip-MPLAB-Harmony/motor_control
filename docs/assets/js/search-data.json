    "content": "Field Oriented Control (FOC): . Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: . | Measure the motor phase currents. | Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. | Calculate the rotor position angle. There are different ways to get the rotor position angle like using PLL estimator or quadrature encoder sensor. | Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. | The stator current’s torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. | The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. | Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. | . PLL Estimator . The working principle of the PLL estimator can be found in Application Note AN2520. Its operating principle is based on the fact that the d-component of the Back Electromotive Force (BEMF) must be equal to zero at a steady state functioning mode. The main disadvantage of PLL estimator is its inability to estimate the rotor angle at lower rotor speeds because of very low value of back EMF. Therefore, the FOC algorithm also integrates the ramp-up profile for motor start. The reference speed is incremented linearly using an open loop phase voltage control until the required minimum reference speed for the PLL estimator is reached. Reduced Order Luenberger Observer . The working principle of the Reduced Order Luenberger Observer can be found in Application Note AN2590. Like any other back EMF based sensorless technique, the main disadvantage of Reduced Order Luenberger Observer is its inability to estimate the rotor angle at lower rotor speeds because of very low value of back EMF. Therefore, the FOC algorithm also integrates the ramp-up profile for motor start. The reference speed is incremented linearly using an open loop phase voltage control until the required minimum reference speed for the observer is reached. Quadrature Encoder . An incremental optical encoder provides two pulse trains which are in quadrature with each other. Some encoders also have an index pulse which helps in finding the precide rotor position spatially. Microcontroller quadrature encoder peripheral is used to capture and decode quadrature encoder siganls. Peripheral gives the rotor position based on the quadrature pulse. And velocity is calculated by measuring encoder pulses in known time interval. PIC32MK QEI peripheral gives the velocity directly. Please refer to the Application Note AN2757 . Field Weakening . The field weakening for PMSM implies imposing a negative value of d-axis current, which has the role of weakening the air gap flux linkage. Field weakening is required to enable the PMSM motor to rotate above its rated speed. An equation based field weakening is implemented. Flying Start . This feature detects if motor shaft is freewheeling due to stored momentum or external force and estimates the rotor angle, speed and direction of the freewheeling motor. If the freewheeling speed is greater than the minimum speed and is rotating in intended direction, this algorithm catches the motor rotation and directly switches to closed loop control. If speed is less then it applies break to halt the motor and starts the control from stationary position. ",

The resistive based techniques cost-effective solution for most of the low and medium power electric drives. Its other advantages include high accuracy, high bandwidth, low temperature drift and unlike magnetic based sensors it does not have any remanence. As with any other techniques resistive based techniques have their own drawbacks. By design, they do not provide any galvanic isolation, and incurs power losses while measurement. Refer AN1332 for more details. Based on where number shunts and their respective location for measuring current in an electric drive, the resistive based techniques can be classified into three categories: . | Three shunt | Dual shunt | Single shunt | . Three shunt . Figure 2 shows a three shunt phase current measurement technique. Figure.2 - Three shunt current measurement . This technique employs three shunt resistors along the three inverter legs. At each modulation cycle, when the low side FETs are switched on, the phase currents are measured. The three shunt current measurement has some advantages. The three shunt technique generally selects the two samples for which the low side FET were switched on for a longer duration, and the third current is calculated from Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL). Hence, a lower bandwidth amplifiers can be used to measure the voltages. Additionally, this makes over-modulation simpler. Dual shunt .

    "title": "Torque Production in three-phase AC motor",
    "content": "A three-phase AC has a stationary part called the stator; a rotating part called the rotor. The stator consists of three-phase windings. When the stator is excited with a balanced three-phase voltage, it generates a rotating magnetic field. The rotor has generates its own magnetic field either using implanted magnets (in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors) or using electromagnets (Synchronous or Asynchronous AC motors). The rotor’s magnetic field interacts with the stator’s rotating magnetic field to produce the rotor torque. Electromagnetic torque is proportional to the cross product of stator currents and rotor flux linkage. Here is a unit vector along the axis of rotation, and are components of a two-dimensional plane perpendicular to , and the current vector is an equivalent vector sum of currents based on how the resulting fields are aligned with these and axes. The angle between flux linkage and current vectors, illustrated in Figure 1, plays an important role in determining electromagnetic torque. If the two vectors are aligned, this angle is zero, and no torque is produced. Maximum torque occurs when the flux linkage and current vectors are perpendicular, and the term . Figure 1. Phasor diagram Figure 1 Flux linkage vector, current vector, and the angle between them, in an arbitrary coordinate frame. It is important to note that these and axes are arbitrary — we can pick any unit basis vectors and that form a mutually perpendicular set with the axis of rotation , such that their cross product . There are two common choices for these basis vectors. One is the stationary frame, commonly aligned with one of the stator phases. Pictured on the left of Figure 2 is a three-phase stator with windings positioned 120° apart. This is equivalent — at least in terms of magnetic flux linkage — to a two-phase stator with orthogonal windings α and β, pictured on the right. For any combination of currents , , in the three-phase stator winding, the same magnetic field seen by the rotor can be produced by an appropriate combination of currents and through two “virtual” coils used to create the horizontal and vertical components of the stator field. The mathematical conversion of projecting three-phase quantities onto these virtual orthogonal coils is called the Clarke transform, after one of its originators, Edith Clarke. [2]. Figure 2. Current vector coils Figure 2 Use of Clarke transform to convert between per-phase quantities and the frame The angle reference is commonly aligned with the first motor phase and the winding. The rotor’s position is some electrical angle relative to these angle references. The Clarke transform is a linear transformation, shown in following equation, which can apply to any vector quantity , although typical examples are voltage , current , or flux linkage . We can substitute in above equation to get the following equation describing torque based on stationary-frame quantities: . In the stationary reference frame, the flux vector and current vector are not fixed, but rotate along with the rotor’s magnetic field. The other common choice of basis vectors is the rotating reference frame, aligned with the electrical angle of excitation as it increases with electrical frequency . This reference frame has components denoted dd (“direct”) and qq (“quadrature”). The transformation from to axes is a rotation by an angle . This is known as the Park transform, named for Robert Park, who developed it in the late 1920s, while working at General Electric to analyze the dynamics of synchronous motors. [1] [3] With permanent-magnet synchronous motors, this reference frame is known as the synchronous reference frame. Correct alignment for a PMSM occurs when the -axis is aligned with the rotor flux, and the electrical angle is identical to the rotor’s electrical angle . We can substitute in Equation 5.2 to obtain Equation 5.9, describing torque based on synchronous-frame quantities: . The advantage of using the synchronous frame is that for steady-state rotation, to produce constant electromagnetic torque , the flux linkage vector and the current vector are constants. This allows current controllers with an integrator term to operate with zero steady-state error. It also allows for independent torque and flux control. It is worth noting that for different motor types, the angle of the reference frame and the electrical angle of the rotor may or may not be identical. For permanent-magnet synchronous motors, the reference frame should be aligned with the permanent magnet flux of the rotor, so that . For induction motors ; the electrical frequency where is the rotor speed expressed as an electrical frequency, and is the slip frequency needed to produce rotor current. ",

    "content": "The general structure of an FOC controller is an inner vector current loop, and an outer velocity loop, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. FOC Block Diagram The inner vector current loop has a current controller that operates in the synchronous frame. Park and Clarke transforms are used in the feedback path to convert measured phase currents to the synchronous frame as inputs to the current controller, and in the forward path to convert desired synchronous-frame voltages to realizable PWM duty cycles in a three-phase bridge. In its linear range, there is nothing particularly special about the vector current loop, and it is often realized as two PI controllers, one for the d axis and the other for the q axis. Saturation and anti-windup should be designed carefully, keeping in mind the overall vector controller, rather than as two independent axis controllers. The following steps summarize the basic sensorless FOC operation: . | Measure the current flowing in the motor. There are several ways to measure the three-phase currents flowing in the motor. Some popular options include measurement using hall-effect or transformer-based magnetic sensors or using strategically placed one, two or three shunt resistors. | Estimate the rotor flux angle. The rotor flux angle can be estimated by either back EMF-based algorithms or by high-frequency pulse injection. | Transform the measured current to reference frame.

The control software has to be cognizant of these analog circuit parameters in order to reconstruct the actual analog signal for control operations. Phase Current Measurement . There are a number of other ways of measuring the phase currents. For brief introduction refer Current Measurement in AC motor drives. DC Bus Voltage Measurement . The DC bus voltage is usually measured by using a resistor based potential divider. Configuring Analog front End with MC Plant . In Motor Control Plant analog parameters can be set in following steps. | Launch Analog Front End by clicking on the block . | Configure Phase A current measurement analog circuit parameters by clicking on the IaSens icon. | Configure Phase B current measurement analog circuit parameters by clicking on the IbSens icon. | Configure DC Bus current measurement analog circuit parameters by clicking on the VdcSens icon. | .

    "content": "Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is an AC synchronous motor driven by a three-phase controlled AC supply. Figure 1 shows a split view of a typical PMSM. Figure.1 - Split view of PMSM Motor . The PMSM has a stationary part called the stator; a rotating part called the rotor. The stator consists of three-phase windings. When the stator is excited with a balanced three-phase voltage, it generates a rotating magnetic field. The rotor has implanted permanent magnets on its core and generates the rotor’s magnetic field. The rotor’s magnetic field interacts with the stator’s rotating magnetic field to produce the rotor torque. PMSMs are broadly classified into the following two categories depending upon the rotor construction: . | Surface-mounted ( SPMSM ) | Interior-buried ( IPMSM ) | . The SPMSM has the permanent magnets fixed on the surface of the rotor leading to a symmetrical air-gap reluctance path between the rotor and the stator core. The IPMSM has the permanent magnets inserted inside the rotor core leading to a non-symmetrical air-gap reluctance path between the rotor and the stator core. Figure 2 shows the transversal-sectional view of surface-mounted and interior buried PMSM rotor configurations. Figure.2 - Rotor transversal section . ",

    "content": "The effective mathematical model of PMSM is critical for controller and observer design for PMSM based variable frequency drives. Even though PMSMs are inherently non-linear systems, they can be modeled as a simple linear time-invariant dynamical system for controller and observer design in most drive applications. The following section briefly introduces a simple linear dynamical model of the PMSM in the stationary and rotational reference frame . Stationary Reference Frame Model . The following equation represents the stationary model of PMSM: . where is the stator voltage in stationary reference frame; is the stator current in stationary reference frame; is the stator back EMF in stationary reference frame; is the stator per phase resistance. is the inductance when the winding axis is aligned to rotor flux axis; is the inductance when the winding axis orthogonal to rotor flux axis; and is the electrical rotor angle. is the permanent magnet flux linkage; and is the electrical speed of the motor. Rotational Reference Frame Model . The rotational reference frame model of the PMSM is derived by linear transformation of the PMSM stationary frame to a rotating reference frame (Park’s Transformation). The transformation essentially converts all sinusoidally varying components to DC components, thereby making control and analysis using classical control very simple. The step wise process of transformation is beyond the scope of this application note. Hence, the final result of the transformation is only shown. Equation 2.4 shows the rotational reference frame model of PMSM. where is the stator phase voltage in rotating reference frame; is the stator phase current vector in rotating reference frame; is the stator resistance; is the electrical speed of the motor; is the permanent magnet flux linkage; is the rotational matrix. is the inductance when the winding axis is aligned to rotor flux axis; and is the inductance when the winding axis orthogonal to rotor flux axis.

    "content": "Rotor position measurement technique can be broadly classified into sensored techniques and sensorless techniques. The sensored techniques uses actual physical sensors to determine the rotor position, whereas sensorless techniques uses estimators or state observers with phase currents and voltages as inputs to determine the rotor angle. Figure 1 shows different measurement rotor position sensing technique used in electric drives. Figure.1 - Rotor Position Sensing Techniques . In this article, we will focus on the few of the popular rotor position measurement techniques, and how to configure them with Motor Control Plant. Quadrature Encoder . Quadrature encoders, also known as incremental encoders or optical encoders, detect position and speed of rotating motion systems. A typical quadrature encoder includes a slotted wheel attached to the shaft of the motor and an emitter/detector module that senses the slots in the wheel. Typically, three output channels, Phase A (QEAx), Phase B (QEBx) and Index (INDXx), provide information on the movement of the motor shaft, including distance and direction. The Phase A and Phase B channels have a unique relationship. If Phase A leads Phase B, the direction of the motor is deemed positive, or forward. If Phase A lags Phase B, the direction of the motor is deemed negative or reverse. The Index pulse occurs once per mechanical revolution and is used as a reference to indicate an absolute position. For a relative timing diagram of these three signals, refer to Figure 1. The quadrature signals produced by the encoder can have four unique states (01, 00, 10 and 11) that reflect the relationship between QEAx and QEBx. Figure 1 shows these states for one count cycle. The order of the states reverses when the direction of travel changes. The quadrature decoder increments or decrements the 16-bit Up/Down Counter (POSxCNT) for each change of state. The counter increments when QEAx leads QEBx and decrements when QEBx leads QEAx. For more details refer AN2757 . Figure.1 - Quadrature Encoder . Back EMF with PLL . The Back EMF with PLL is a technique where the BEMF is used to estimate speed and position. It is based on the principle that when the stator and rotor magnetic fluxes are orthogonal to each other, the BEMF across the d-axis is ‘0’. The PLL is used to drive d-axis BEMF to zero, thereby estimating the rotor position and speed. For more details refer AN2520 . Reduced Order Luenberger Observer . The Reduced Order Luenberger Observer (ROLO) belongs to a class of linear observers used to estimate the internal state of an observable system based on the measured input and output. The ROLO is used to estimate the back EMFs of the PMSM. The BEMF vector position is found with an arctan() operation from the BEMF components, which is then used to estimate the rotor position angle. For more details refer AN2590 . Sliding Mode Observer . The Sliding Mode Observers (SMO) belongs to a class of non-linear observers used to estimate the internal state of an observable system based on the measured input and output. The SMO is used to estimate the back EMFs of the PMSM. The BEMF vector position is found with an arctan() operation from the BEMF components, which is then used to estimate the rotor position angle.

Sensorless estimation techniques are used to estimate motor position for commutation and velocity control. User input is provided with a potentiometer and buttons to start and stop the motor, or to reverse direction. A state machine is used to control the transitions between these different modes of operation. The motor startup process involves so-called “open-loop” operation. When the motor is at rest or moving very slowly, the sensorless estimator is not accurate enough; instead, a special set of states is provided to manage startup, in which commutation is forced at a desired acceleration rate, and the velocity control loop is disabled. Figure XX shows a high level block diagram of the software. ",

    "content": "The sensorless position estimation techniques based on back-EMF require a minimum value of back EMF to estimate the electrical position of the rotor. The open-loop start-up procedure drives the PMSM till its speed reaches the minimum value where the back EMF values are large enough to estimate the rotor position. In the open-loop start-up procedure, the speed loop is de-activated. The currents are controlled directly in the dq reference frame by using assumed rotor position angles for transformations. The complete start-up procedure can be divided into following phases: . | Initial Field Alignment. In this phase, the PMSM rotor is locked to a specified rotor position by keeping a fixed rotor position angle. The d-axis or q-axis current is gradually ramped to the a specified value to avoid any over-current issues. | Open-loop Ramp. In this phase, the rotor position is constantly incremented based on user-defined ramp time to achieve the minimum required speed for the BEMF observer. The minimum ramp time and speed depend on PMSM drive electrical and mechanical parameters. This stage is the most critical step. Any mistuning of reference speed and acceleration can lead to start-up failure. | Stabilization. In this phase, the PMSM is allowed to rotate at a constant open-loop speed. This step ensures a smooth transition to close loop mode. | . Figure 1 shows a complete start-up procedure for a sensorless PMSM motor drive: . Figure.1 - Open-loop Start-up Procedure .

    "content": "## Software Design ### SAMC21 and PIC32CM MC - PMSM FOC Control loop is implemented in the ADC result ready interrupt. Refer to the flow chart given below. - ADC channel conversion is triggered by the PWM overflow/zero match event. This trigger point could vary based on the current measurement techniques and MCU PWM IP implementation. - For bandwidth constraints, the FOC is executed every alternate PWM cycle - Slow loop task is executed in every 10ms in the task process. Polling of switches for user inputs is handled in the slow loop task. ### Timing Diagram ![timing_diagram](/motor_control/algorithms/pmsm_foc/images/timing_diagram_fixed_point.jpg) ### Flow Chart ![flow_chart](/motor_control/algorithms/pmsm_foc/images/flow_chart_fixed_point.jpg) ### State Machine - **Idle**: In this state, control waits for the switch press. - **Field Alignment**: Rotor is aligned to known position at D-axis or Q-axis by applying a pre-defined value of the current for a pre-defined length of time. The magnitude of the current and the length of the time for which it is applied depends upon the electrical and mechanical time constant of the PMSM motor drive. Electrical time constant of the motor is a function of R and L values of the motor windings, whereas the mechanical time constant of the motor drive is primarily a function of the static load on the motor shaft. - **Open Loop**: This state is applicable to sensorless position feedback methods. In this state, the speed of the PMSM motor is gradually ramped up using an open loop control. During this mode, the rotor angle is derived from the asserted open loop speed reference. This derived rotor angle would be lagging from the actual rotor angle. The speed is ramped up linearly to a minimum value required for the PLL estimator to estimate the electrical speed of the PMSM motor with sufficient accuracy. Rotor angle information is obtained by integrating the estimated electrical speed of the motor. - **Closed Loop**: Control switched to closed loop and rotor angle is obtained from the configured position feedback method. ### Code Structure ![code_structure](/motor_control/algorithms/pmsm_foc/images/code_structure_fixed_point.jpg) Configurations: - mc_userparameters.h contains the user configurations.

The page will reload if you make edits.\\ You will also see any lint errors in the console. ### `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\\ See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. ### `yarn build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\\ It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\\ Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information. ### `yarn eject` **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!** If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own. You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. ## Learn More You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
